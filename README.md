# AI Engineer Tutor

Language: [中文](./README.zh-CN.md) | English

AI Engineer Tutor’s intent stays the same: use AI to empower end‑to‑end full‑stack delivery, improving speed and quality. This update only optimizes the folder structure for clarity, scalability, and navigation.

**Vision**
- Embed AI assistance into every phase
- Provide role‑based toolkits and practices
- Ensure each phase produces assets directly consumable by the next

**Scope**
- Phases: a complete loop from requirements to iteration
- Roles: Product, Design, Backend, Frontend, Data, QA, DevOps, PM
- Outputs: requirements, system design, API contracts, data models, code, tests, deployment plans

**Workflow**
- Select the phase and the roles involved
- Apply AI tools and prompts tailored to that phase
- Produce reusable phase artifacts
- Iterate with best practices and checklists

## Usage
- Start from phases/, pick your current phase, and use role guides in roles/
- Choose architecture patterns or evolvable paths under architecture/
- Execute build, test, deploy, and operations from lifecycle/
- Use assessments/ checklists as quality gates

## Intended Outcomes
- Faster delivery while maintaining engineering quality
- Standardized, reusable phase artifacts
- Smoother collaboration with clearer role boundaries
- Traceable decisions from requirements to production
