# AI Engineer Tutor

AI Engineer Tutor helps teams build full‑stack products with AI support at every phase. The project provides stage‑specific AI tools, techniques, and role guidance so each phase’s output feeds the next, accelerating delivery while keeping quality high.

## Vision
Enable AI‑assisted full‑stack delivery from idea to production by:
- Embedding AI support into every phase of work
- Providing role‑based AI toolkits and practices
- Ensuring each phase produces assets usable by the next phase

## What This Project Covers
- **Phases**: discovery, design, architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and iteration
- **Roles**: product, UX/UI, backend, frontend, data, QA, DevOps, and project management
- **Outputs**: requirements, system design, API contracts, data models, code, tests, deployment plans

## Project Structure

### Phases (Sequential Workflow)
Although the directories are named without numbers, the recommended flow is:

1.  **[discovery](phases/discovery)**: Requirement analysis & market research.
2.  **[design](phases/design)**: UX/UI design & prototyping.
3.  **[architecture](phases/architecture)**: System design & tech stack selection.
4.  **[implementation](phases/implementation)**: Coding & development.
5.  **[testing](phases/testing)**: QA & integration testing.
6.  **[deployment](phases/deployment)**: CI/CD & release management.
7.  **[iteration](phases/iteration)**: Feedback loops & maintenance.

### Other Directories
- **roles/**: Specific guidance for each role (Product, Design, Eng, etc.).
- **practices/**: General AI best practices, management, and ethics.

## How It Works
1. **Select a phase** and identify the role(s) involved
2. **Apply AI tools and prompts** tailored to that phase
3. **Produce artifacts** that become inputs to the next phase
4. **Iterate** with AI‑guided best practices and checklists

## Best Practices Included
- Clear phase boundaries and handoff artifacts
- Structured prompts for predictable outcomes
- Quality gates for architecture, code, and tests
- Practical guidance on AI usage, collaboration, and management

## Intended Outcomes
- Faster delivery without sacrificing quality
- Consistent project artifacts across phases
- Improved collaboration between roles
- Traceable decisions from requirements to production

## Audience
Engineering teams, product teams, and individuals who want to integrate AI into a professional full‑stack workflow.
